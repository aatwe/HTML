How to incorportate images into website 
src= source = url/local image in same directory as website
alt= alternative text = if browser cannot render image, it will display the alternative text
	Used to describe what image was about	
	//Google looks at this alt

<img src= alt=>

How do we get this image? we ping the image address server where this image is hosted
browser downloads from there

What if the server goes down-> Image will no longer be hosted/available at source
Solution: put image in local project ->IMages folder
	And add a path to it
